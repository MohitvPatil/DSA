# 📚 Data Structures & Algorithms Practice Repository

This repository contains my **Data Structures and Algorithms (DSA)** implementations and problem-solving practice in:

- **C++**
- **JavaScript**
- **Python**

The goal of this repository is to build **strong problem-solving skills**, improve **coding efficiency**, and maintain a **well-structured reference** for interview preparation and competitive programming.
